  <p>Horneater stew, named after the Horneaters of Roshar, is a simple dish. There are, however, two important mistakes one could make while attempting this recipe. First, the ingredients consist of whatever you have at hand. These may include but are not limited to the following. Cremlings for protein and crunch, tubers or other root vegetables to give it some body, cuts of meat (soul-cast would be the most authentic) and spices. Second, one should never let airsick lowlanders mess with the spice mixture. The heads of lowlanders are just about as thick as the very air they breathe. Thus, they shouldn't be allowed near the pot. </p>
